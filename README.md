# Server_Monitoring

In this project, I have created a challenging server monitoring project. Leveraging Python and Oracle database, I developed a script tob efficiently manage and track a vast network of IP addresses. This project was a steep learning curve, but Iâ€™m proud to have overcome obstacles and deliver a valuable solution. 

I have used Oracle Database, Sql plus and Python programming Language to create a unique script in which it is able to tell that the given set of ip os properly reachable or not. In the formal term also called as 'IP is pinging ' or not . And If any ip is not pinging then it plays an alert sound whenever it comes .

Trust me this project is amazing as it sounds like ....
I hope it will be helpful to you also. ...................
